Working for a company is no easy feat and may not be suitable for everyone! However, it is a great starting point and a vast field to hone skills and gather more experience in your niche.

## The Pros

- **Work Ethic**: Knowing that your salary and other benefits depend on "[The Art of Showing Up](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Showing-Up-Yourself-People/dp/1615196617)" will impact your discipline and work ethic. It will surely get you into "the machine."
- **Company Vision**: Your primary goal should be to follow your company's vision and mission. For example, a marketing agency has the mission to provide the best services to customers, requiring passionate and meaningful work while simultaneously excelling yourself. (_Pro tip: adopt the "3 visions rule": vision of the company, vision of the client, and team vision of solving the problem. Employers love this!_)
- **Other People**: Most of the time, you won't work alone! You'll either have those above you, your team, or both. This is a fabulous opportunity to practice soft skills, communication, and teamwork. For the new "TikTok" generation, accepting their role seriously may help with social awkwardness, stuttering, introversion, etc.
- **Skills**: Once everything is set up, the only thing left to do, which is easier said than done, is the actual work! During the execution process, unforgettable skills and experiences are forged. Keep that in mind, and choose a company/role that meets all of your needs and expectations!

## The Cons

- **Boss**: Some people may find comfort and success in working "standard" jobs, while others, like myself, may not! Working for a company may limit your time, opportunities, and ability to achieve your ideas, not to mention personal businesses, etc.
- **Problems**: There will be constant problems, whether you believe it (or see it) or not! Some may not impact you, but others will. Understand that people are under pressure, have various kinds of other problems, and may start disputes. But don't be afraid to speak up against injustice and exploitation!
- **Enjoyment**: If your workplace is monotonous and simple, with little activity and change, it may bore you immensely over time. For those who want a more dynamic work environment, it might be a potential problem. No wonder today's job offers mention "dynamic work environment." Think about it!

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are many pros and cons regarding corporate jobs. The right thing to do is to decide for yourself, based on your needs and expectations, what suits you the most. Please don't follow "life gurus" word-for-word since that is often a nicely packaged scam and exploitation! Rather, listen to yourself, follow your passion, and be yourself!

For IT rookies and other computer-related niches, I suggest you gain as many skills as possible by educating yourself, learning from personal projects, and freelancing. Then, I recommend working for a couple of companies for a maximum of 2 years. Be sure to learn from those experiences as much as possible. After that, you may create your own product/service/business/company or balance having both the job and something of your own.

Good luck, and don't forget to focus and put in the work!
