Hackathons are a thrilling and intense environment where creativity, innovation, and teamwork come together under tight deadlines. Recently, I had the privilege to participate in a hackathon held in the beautiful city of Mostar, organized by BEST Mostar. This 36-hour competition was an unforgettable experience, pushing the boundaries of what I thought was possible. In this blog, I'll dive into my personal experiences, the highs and lows of the event, and the key takeaways from this competitive coding adventure.

## Setting the Stage: Mostar and the Event

Mostar, a city known for its picturesque landscapes and historic landmarks, provided a stunning backdrop for the hackathon. The event brought together tech enthusiasts from all over Bosnia, each eager to showcase their skills and collaborate on innovative projects. The challenge set before us was to develop an application, either mobile or web-based, that would _enhance education and/or learning platforms through the integration of AI._

## The Beginning: Excitement and Enthusiasm

As the hackathon kicked off, the atmosphere was electric. Participants buzzed with excitement, discussing ideas with their teams. The diversity of backgrounds and expertise among the contestants was incredible, promising a wide array of creative solutions.

## The Challenge: Developing an AI-Integrated Educational App

The task was both exhilarating and daunting: create an application that leverages AI to make education easier and more entertaining. We brainstormed ideas, sketched out prototypes, and divided tasks based on our strengths. The initial hours flew by as we delved into coding, designing, and problem-solving.

## The Reality: Fatigue and Frustration

As the hours passed, the initial excitement began to wane. Fatigue set in, and the pressure of the tight deadline loomed large. Many teams struggled with technical challenges, integration issues, and the sheer scope of the project. Some participants, unable to cope with the stress, decided to quit, while others submitted incomplete projects. Our team faced the similar outcome.

## The Results: Balance between Perfectionism and Output

Despite the obstacles and project scale, my team was eager to build a full web-based application that enhanced learning with GhatGPT integration. We had reasonable expertise for our goals, but we faced the harsh truth! Team of 3 can never achieve perfect results we had in mind for only 36, plus they were consecutive. After the results came, we were shocked to know the team that had the best UI/UX design and very bare-bones IT solution had won the hackaton.

## Key Takeaways: Lessons Learned

- **Teamwork is Crucial**: Effective collaboration and communication were key to our progress. Each team member's unique skills and perspectives contributed to the final product.

- **Perseverance Pays Off**: The hackathon tested our endurance and resilience. Pushing through fatigue and frustration was essential to reaching the finish line.

- **Adaptability is Essential**: We encountered numerous unexpected challenges, requiring us to be flexible and think on our feet.

- **Learning Through Doing**: The hands-on experience of building an application in such a short time was invaluable. We gained practical knowledge that no amount of theoretical study could match.

- **Product over Perfection**: The experience taught us the importance of prioritizing functionality and user experience over achieving perfection. It’s better to deliver a working solution that meets essential criteria rather than aiming for flawless execution within constrained timeframes.

- **Networking Opportunities**: The event was a fantastic opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals, potential collaborators, and industry professionals.

## Conclusion

Participating in the hackathon in Mostar was an incredible journey filled with learning, challenges, and a sense of accomplishment. The beautiful setting, the competitive yet collaborative environment, and the focus on innovation made it a memorable experience. Whether you win or lose, the skills and experiences gained from such events are invaluable. I look forward to the next hackathon, armed with the lessons learned and the memories made in Mostar.

If you’ve ever considered participating in a hackathon, I highly recommend it.

Dive in, embrace the chaos, and come out the other side with new skills, new friends, and perhaps even a prize!
