In today’s interconnected world, privacy is a hot topic—and for a good reason. As a somebody deeply involved in technology, I continuously research how companies collect, process, and sometimes exploit user data. While some may dismiss privacy concerns as paranoia, I believe it’s a moral and practical responsibility to be aware of what’s happening under the hood of the software we use. Here’s how I’ve approached this challenge and why you might want to consider doing the same.

## **Let's start with Windows telemetry**

For years, Windows has been the default operating system for many devices worldwide. But with convenience comes compromise. Microsoft’s telemetry features are well-known for gathering data—from how you use your system to potentially sensitive personal information. While the company claims this data helps improve the user experience, the sheer volume of information collected raises questions.

As a concerning development, rumors suggest that an upcoming half-year release of Windows may integrate Microsoft's AI as a dependency for `explorer.exe`. This raises the potential risk of involuntary file indexing by the AI. While companies may promise "private" or "encrypted" computing, Microsoft's track record in handling user privacy leaves much to be desired—especially when compared to Apple, which has a comparatively stronger reputation for safeguarding user data.

Switching from Windows to a more privacy-conscious operating system felt like an ethical and practical step for me. That’s when I made a leap for **Linux (Fedora)**.

## **Why Linux?!**

Transitioning to Linux Fedora was transformative—not just in terms of privacy but also performance. Linux greatly respects user data by design, ensuring that your system works for _you_, not the other way around. Since making the switch, I’ve noticed my resources usage to be significantly lower (obviously). Less background processing generally means less data collection.

## **Is VSCode really "Free"?**

As developers, many of us use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) daily. It’s a robust, feature-rich IDE, but let’s not overlook a crucial aspect: **telemetry data collection**. Microsoft gathers usage data from VSCode, which is unsurprising given the famous adage, _“When software is free, you are the product.”_

Thankfully, there are open-source alternatives like **VSCodium**, which strips away telemetry while retaining the core functionality of VSCode. By using VSCodium, I can develop software without feeling like I’m part of someone else’s data stream.

## **Why is your data so valuable?**

Ever wondered why companies are so eager to collect data? Your digital footprint helps advertisers and AI companies craft eerily precise predictions about your preferences. For instance, the infamous story of someone granting microphone access to an app and talking about “dog toys” led to targeted ads about pet supplies—despite not owning a dog! This highlights how far-reaching and invasive data collection can be.

I came to realise that to have influence, firstly you need wealth. Secondly power, and lastly information! You can assume what these guys have or don't have...

But it’s not just about ads. Companies often sell your data to third parties, train AI models with it, or use it to fine-tune their targeting algorithms. The implications are staggering, especially for those of us who value control over our digital lives.

## **Why should privacy matter to you!**

As a developer, I have a unique perspective on how software is built and maintained. I understand why some people might not care about privacy—perhaps they feel they have “nothing to hide” or trust corporations to act ethically. But for me, it’s a matter of principle. If I, someone technically literate, turn a blind eye, how can I expect others to care?

For me, protecting my privacy is about more than just avoiding ads or data tracking—it’s about reclaiming ownership of my digital identity. It’s a stand against the commodification of our personal lives.

## **What did I do regarding privacy!?**

One of the most empowering decisions I made was to self-host essential services. Here’s what I’ve done to ensure my privacy remains intact:

- **Media Server**: Set up my own server to manage entertainment without relying on data-hungry streaming platforms.
- **Custom DNS (AdGuard)**: Block ads and trackers at the network level for a cleaner, faster, and more private browsing experience.
- **VPN (WireGuard)**: Created my own VPN to secure my internet traffic and bypass potential surveillance, and save a few quid/bucks.
- **AI Server (Ollama)**: Built an AI server to explore and use machine learning tools without handing over my data to external providers, also saving me money.
- **Privacy Hardening**: Disabled intrusive privacy settings across all devices.

Each step has brought me closer to a digital life that feels private, secure, and under my control.

## **Your data, your choice, my opinion**

Privacy is a ultimatly a personal choice. Some may argue that trading privacy for convenience is worth it, and that’s a valid perspective. But for those who believe in the ethical implications of data collection, the journey to reclaiming privacy is not just a technical one—it’s much more than that.

If you’re a developer or a tech enthusiast like me, consider taking small steps toward protecting your privacy. Whether it’s switching to Linux, using open-source tools, self-hosting your services or something else—every effort counts. **Your data is your power**, let’s ensure it stays that way.
