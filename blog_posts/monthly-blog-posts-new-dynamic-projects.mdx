Since starting my blog on [_May 3, 2024_](https://bakir.dev/blog/why-im-starting-this-blog-journey-into-purpose), I’ve committed to sharing insights and experiences weekly, every Friday. However, life has taken an exciting turn recently, and I’ve decided to shift my publishing schedule to monthly instead of weekly. Why the change? Let me explain...

Over the past few months, I’ve been immersing myself in various projects that are incredibly fulfilling yet time-consuming. These include a mix of self-improvement endeavors, entrepreneurial ventures, and other creative projects. I’m fully dedicated to growing in these areas, which naturally means I need to allocate more time and focus. As a result, posting weekly on Fridays no longer fits with this new rhythm.

That said, I want to reassure you that my blog is far from slowing down. I’ll be continuing to share my learnings, especially from these exciting projects, but the cadence will shift to a monthly format. This will allow me to provide deeper, more refined content that aligns with what I’m currently working on, and I believe the quality of the posts will only improve with this focus.

I look forward to keeping you updated on my journey, and I encourage you to stay tuned for insights that will dive into my entrepreneurial lessons, personal growth strategies, and the projects I’m most passionate about.

The switch to monthly blogs is simply a reflection of the exciting and busy times ahead. Thanks for being part of the journey, and I can’t wait to share more with you soon!

Feel free to explore past posts in the meantime :)
